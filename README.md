# Agent Setup Repository

A comprehensive collection of GitHub Copilot instructions and configurations for different project structures, providing guidance on how to effectively utilize AI assistants in your development workflow.

## üìö Repository Overview

This repository contains structured guidelines and configurations for leveraging GitHub Copilot and other AI-assisted development tools across different project environments. It serves as a central resource for teams looking to standardize their approach to AI-assisted development.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`instructions/`**: Contains template instructions for different project structures
  - **`nextjs/`**: GitHub Copilot instructions specifically tailored for Next.js projects
  - **`template_for_agents.md`**: General template for AI agent instructions that can be adapted for various contexts
- **`mcp/`**: Model Context Protocol configurations
  - **`mcpServers.json`**: Configuration for different MCP servers including Playwright, Context7, and sequential-thinking

## ü§ñ About Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a communication protocol that enables AI models to interact with various tools and services. This repository includes configurations for several MCP servers:

- **Playwright MCP**: For browser automation and testing
- **Context7 MCP**: For enhanced context-aware AI responses
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: For breaking down complex problems into sequential steps

## üöÄ How to Use These Templates

### For Next.js Projects

1. Copy the appropriate instructions from `instructions/nextjs/copilot-instructions.md` into your project's documentation
2. Customize the instructions to fit your project's specific requirements
3. Share these guidelines with your team to establish consistent practices for working with GitHub Copilot

### Using MCP Configurations

1. Copy the `mcp/mcpServers.json` file to your project
2. Install the required dependencies via npm:
   ```bash
   npm install @playwright/mcp @upstash/context7-mcp @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
   ```
3. Reference these configurations in your development environment

### General Agent Instructions

The `template_for_agents.md` provides a comprehensive framework for AI agent instructions, covering:
- Initial context and setup
- Communication guidelines
- Tool usage guidelines
- Code change guidelines
- Debugging practices
- External API integration

## üí° Best Practices

When using GitHub Copilot with these templates:

1. **Well-Scoped Tasks**: Ensure issues assigned to Copilot are clear and well-defined
2. **Appropriate Task Selection**: Assign suitable tasks like bug fixes, test coverage, and documentation updates
3. **Code Review**: Always review Copilot-generated code for security and quality
4. **Iterative Feedback**: Batch comments when reviewing Copilot's work for more coherent updates
