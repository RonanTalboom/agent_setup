## üí° Best Practices

When using GitHub Copilot with these templates:

1. **Well-Scoped Tasks**: Ensure issues assigned to Copilot are clear and well-defined
2. **Appropriate Task Selection**: Assign suitable tasks like bug fixes, test coverage, and documentation updates
3. **Code Review**: Always review Copilot-generated code for security and quality
4. **Iterative Feedback**: Batch comments when reviewing Copilot's work for more coherent updates
